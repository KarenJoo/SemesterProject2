## Description

BestBid auction app envisions a world where everyone can access quality,  sustainable interiors and items at affordable prices. 
BestBid aim to create a community that values both the environment and budget-friendly living while the user discovers their dream listing! 

With their slogan "Your dream is one bid away" BestBid encourages you to take action and create your budget-friendly living", ensuring that everyone can take a chance and place a bid to get their dream environment.

All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.

## Goal:
"An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings." - SP2 Brief, Noroff.
